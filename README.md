## Audio Sentiment Analysis

Repository for the audio sentiment analysis module of the ESA project.

This repository contains the following directories:
* data: use this directory to place the datasets required in your code and notebooks. The required datasets will be hosted in a different place, do not upload data to this repository.
* data/raw: this directory is used for the original data related to the solution. Treat the data in this directory as inmutable.
* data/proprocessed: this directory should contain the modified data generated by appliying transformations for the raw data.
* models: this repository can be used to contain trained models. Do not upload your trained models to this repository; they will hosted in a different repository.
* prototypes: this directory contains the python scripts and notebooks used to explore tools and approaches that could be used for our project.
* src: this directory contains the code required for training and using models for sentiment analysis
* src/feature_extraction: in this directory, put the code used for feature extraction
* src/modeling: here, put the code for designing, training, and evaluating models
* testing: here, put the code used to test the intelligent solution to be deployed
